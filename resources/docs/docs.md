### Database Configuration is Required

If you haven't already, then please follow the steps below to configure your database connection and run the necessary migrations.

* Create the database for your application.
* Update the connection URL in the `profiles.clj` file with your database name and login.
* Run `lein run migrate` in the root of the project to create the tables.
* Restart the application.

### SassC libsass command-line compiler is required

You must have the SassC command-line compiler installed to use this feature.

Please follow the instructions at: <a href="http://github.com/sass/sassc">http://github.com/sass/sassc</a>
to install the compiler for your platform.

### Usage
Compile your files once:
```
$ lein sassc once
```

To delete all the files generated by lein-sassc:
```
$ lein sassc clean
```

To recompile when any changes are made:

```
$ lein auto sassc once
```

### Hooks
The following hooks are supported by lein-sassc:
```
$ lein compile
$ lein clean
```

Because lein-sassc requires a binary to compile Sass, it often won't work on platforms like Heroku which compile the application on their servers. To get around this limitation, commit the generated CSS files and remove

```
:hooks [leiningen.sassc]
```

from project.clj.

### Managing Your Middleware

Request middleware functions are located under the `annotare.middleware` namespace.

This namespace is reserved for any custom middleware for the application. Some default middleware is
already defined here. The middleware is assembled in the `wrap-base` function.

Middleware used for development is placed in the `annotare.dev-middleware` namespace found in
the `env/dev/clj/` source path.
